# Netflix Clone Project

Welcome to our Netflix clone built with Next.js! This project is a simple imitation aimed at replicating the look and feel of Netflix. We've utilized several modern web technologies and frameworks to create this app, including Tailwind CSS for styling, Material-UI for components, and ShadcnUI for additional UI elements.

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building user interfaces with server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly designing custom user interfaces.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework that provides ready-made components following Material Design guidelines.
- **ShadcnUI**: A React-based UI library offering additional flexible components for building modern web applications.
